# React Homework

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repo
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the tests: `npm run test-tier-1`
4. Open a second terminal and run the React App: `npm start`

Your goal here is to make all the tests pass. The tests are organized in tiers.
You are advised to work through these tiers in order (`tests/tier-1` followed
by `tests/tier-2.js`, etc). Our testing framework, Jest, will automatically re-run the tests for you when it detects a relevant file has been changed and saved (e.g. `PetList.js`). We recommended to turn off "autosave".

The only code you need to write is in the `src/components` folder. You are free to edit those files as much as you need to to get the tests to pass. Please do not modify the tests. Each tier has instructions and hints at the top. _Please read the hints carefully before beginning the tests._ They are there to help you!

When you have succesfully passed all tier-1 tests, you then can run `npm run test-tier-2` in the terminal and start working through tier-2 tests. Likewise, tier-3 tests can be run with `npm run test-tier-3` and tier-4 tests `npm run test-tier-4`. Please clear your terminal with the command `clear` when switching to a different tier. You do have the option of running all tests with `npm test` however, this is not advised because there will be so much output to the terminal it may overflow and not display properly.

As you work through the tests, you are encouraged to view the running React application in your browser. If you'd like to see how your React application responds to server errors, take a look at `app.js` -- you will find code in the comments to simulate a server that takes a long time to respond, or simply responds with an error.
